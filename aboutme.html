									<h3 class="major">About Me</h3>
									<p>Tackling health problems has always been important to me.
										As a Peruvian-American born and raised outside of Washington D.C. I've witnessed firsthand how social determinants affect health at an individual, community, and population level.<p>
									<p>During my undergraduate and master's experience at Johns Hopkins University, I was exposed to health problems in Baltimore that are a result of a broken education system, environmental racism, food apartheid, and inequailty in access to healthcare.
										Seeing these disparities motiviated me to take part in addressing these issues during my Public Health studies.</p>

									<p>Whether it was performing HIV-testing for trans individuals participating in the LITE trial, conducting a study on homelessness for the city of Baltimore, or co-authoring a manuscript on Zika prevention research in Guatemala, my love of research and desire to identify the signal in the noise* has been a driving force in my education and career (*Nate Silver reference, anyone?).<p>

									<p>After spending a year and a half coordinating a clinical research trial at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and subsequently completing a 3-month immersive Data Science bootcamp through General Assembly, I am prepared to obtain, clean, and utilize both qualitative and quantitative data to inform and drive healthcare solutions through machine-learning and data analytics.<p>

									<p>My portfolio of data science projects ranges from a screening tool for mental health disorders that utilizes natural language processing to using recurrent neural networks to predict COVID-19 vaccination rates in Massachusetts. 
										Health-focused projects like these are very personal to me, especially since I was diagnosed with a form of non-Hodgkins Lymphoma in 2021 (that I am now in remission for)!<p>

									<p>If anything in my portfolio stands out to you, or if you'd like to chat about the intersection of global health and data science, please don't hesitate to reach out!<p>
